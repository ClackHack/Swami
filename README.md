# Syntax
the syntax in swami# is a little tricky

to call a function the syntax is as follows

functionName output_variable : arg1,arg2

functionName : arg1, arg2

functionName

call if statements and loops using if bool and loop bool

NO semicolons, brackets {like these} are required

every line will be a function call or a loop,function,if statement declaration

call function or vars to see variables and builtin/written functions

ALL variables are global
