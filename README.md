# Swami#
 A low level python base language based on Swami Shaggy
 Credits in terminal
# Syntax
the syntax in swami# is a little tricky

to call a function the syntax is as follows

functionName output_variable : arg1,arg2

functionName : arg1, arg2

functionName

define functions:

def funcName

end function with zoinks return_value

call if statements and loops using if bool and loop bool

end if statements with jeepers

end functions and loops with zoinks

NO semicolons, brackets {like these} are required

every line will be a function call or a loop,function,if statement declaration

call function or vars to see variables and builtin/written functions

ALL variables are global

# Terminal
Use file yourfilename.txt to create a file or edit it

Use run yourfilename.txt to run a file

Use programs to see all your programs

Use exit to, you guessed it, exit the terminal

# A final word
Swami# is by no means a programming language to be taken seriously, it is more a fun project, but if youd like, try to learn it, its incredibly quick to pick up because its so basic
